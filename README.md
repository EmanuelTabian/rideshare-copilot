## Description

This application assists drivers in calculating their weekly net income, tracking their earnings trends, and managing car rentals by allowing them to buy, rent, or sell their own vehicles.

### Inspiration

This front-end project is highly inspired by the [Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW) by Jonas Schmedtmann. Additionally, the demo version of the **Wild Oasis** app, that served as inspiration can be found [here](https://the-wild-oasis.vercel.app/login).

**The Wild Oasis** leverages essential front-end capabilities of the **React.js framework** and integrates seamlessly with a backend configured on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). My ambition was to develop a **custom backend** for Rideshare Copilot using **Python**, **Django**, and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring a tailored and robust solution for managing rideshare operations.

- For more information about the Rideshare Copilot backend, access this repository [here](https://github.com/EmanuelTabian/rideshare-copilot-backend).

### Overview

The application requires user **authentication**. Upon successful login, users can engage in a variety of activities such as browsing car rental listings, posting their own rental offers, calculating earnings based on commission rates and other expenses, and saving this data to generate earnings trend charts and additional insights.
